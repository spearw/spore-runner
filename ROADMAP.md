# Fish Food - Design Roadmap

## Core Design Philosophy

Fish Food is an underwater bullet-heaven roguelike emphasizing **thematic cohesion** through deck-character linking while maintaining mechanical depth via multiplicative scaling and intelligent encounter generation.

### Technical Pillars
1. **Data-Driven Content**: All weapons, enemies, artifacts, and upgrades must be creatable via .tres resources and scene inheritance WITHOUT writing new GDScript code.
2. **Scalable Performance**: Architecture must handle 200+ enemies and projectiles simultaneously. See CLAUDE.md for optimization patterns.

## Upgrade & Deck System

### Deck Structure (~15 cards each)
| Type | Count | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Weapons | 3 | Unique weapons per deck |
| Weapon Upgrades | 6 | 2 per weapon, enabling transformations |
| Artifacts | 3 | Unique passive effects (require custom code) |
| Synergy Upgrades | 3 | Deck-specific mechanical synergies |

### Core Deck (Universal)
Available every run regardless of deck selection:
- Damage
- Move Speed
- Projectile Speed
- Critical Chance
- Critical Damage
- Luck

**Note**: Core deck contains NO weapons - only stat upgrades.

### Weapon Upgrade Philosophy
- **One weapon upgrade per weapon per run** (prevents stacking on same weapon)
- Upgrades are **multiplicative modifiers on player stats**, not individual weapons
- Ensures consistency across different weapon attack speeds

---

## Character System

### Character-Deck Linking
- Each character thematically tied to a specific deck
- Characters receive **exclusive starting weapon** from their deck
- Player can select a **secondary deck** for build variety

### Example
> "Fire Mage" starts with Fire Staff and has access to the Fire deck. Player can pick a secondary deck (e.g., Melee) for hybrid builds.

---

## Encounter Director

### Tag-Based Enemy System
Instead of predefined enemy sets, use **dynamic tagging**:

```
Enemy Tags: [freshwater, fish, small, fast]
Level Tags: [freshwater, cave] → weights freshwater enemies higher
```

### Benefits
- Thematic cohesion per level/biome
- Runtime pool generation for variety
- Future-proof for new mechanics

### Tag-Based Mechanics (Future)
- **Weapon bonuses**: "Salt" weapon deals bonus damage to "freshwater" or "slug" tagged enemies
- **Difficulty-based counter-spawning**: See Difficulty System section below

### Encounter Configs
Encounter configs are randomly selected at run start and shown to the player via a banner. They weight enemy spawns without changing which enemies CAN spawn (that's the biome's job).

**Architecture:**
- **Biome** = hard filter (which enemies CAN spawn)
- **EncounterConfig** = soft weights (which enemies are MORE LIKELY)
- **Points curve** = difficulty scaling over time
- **Randomness** = variety within weighted selection

**Current Configs:**
- `swarm_tiny_small_config` → "Swarm Infestation" - Large groups of small enemies
- `armored_large_config` → "Armored Assault" - Heavily armored foes
- `ranged_evasive_config` → "Ranged Barrage" - Enemies attack from distance
- `large_slow_config` → "Slow Horrors" - Slow but deadly creatures

---

## Difficulty System (Future)

### Overview
Difficulty modes that dynamically adjust encounter weights based on the player's build.

### EASY Mode
- Analyzes player's selected upgrades, weapons, and artifacts
- Identifies tags the player is strong against
- **Increases** spawn weight for enemies the player counters well
- Makes runs feel powerful and rewarding for new players

### HARD Mode
- Analyzes player's selected upgrades, weapons, and artifacts
- Identifies tags the player is weak against
- **Increases** spawn weight for enemies that counter the player's build
- Prevents repetitive "solved" strategies
- Forces adaptation and build variety

### Implementation Notes
- `EncounterDirector` already tracks `current_threat` by behavior tags
- Need to add: player build tag analysis
- Need to add: dynamic weight adjustment based on difficulty mode
- Configs remain the base; difficulty mode applies a multiplier layer on top

---

## Armor System

### Formula
```
damage_taken = max(0, damage - armor)
```

### Trade-offs
- **Speed penalty**: ~1% move speed reduction per armor point
- Heavy armor = slower but tankier

### Armor Penetration
- Percentage-based armor reduction
- Example: 75% penetration → enemy armor is 25% effective
- 100% penetration = full armor bypass (counter to tank builds)

---

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- [x] Core gameplay loop (move, shoot, level up)
- [x] Upgrade/rarity system with packs
- [x] Budget-based enemy spawning
- [x] Meta-progression (souls, unlocks)
- [x] Meta shop with tabs (Stats, Characters, Packs)
- [x] Multiple characters and weapons
- [x] Status effects and projectile variants
- [x] Enemy tag system (biome, type, size, behavior tags)
- [x] Biome-based enemy pool filtering
- [x] Encounter config system with random selection at run start

### In Progress
- [ ] Character-deck exclusive linking
- [ ] Secondary deck selection UI
- [ ] Encounter config banner UI (show selected config to player)

### Planned
- [ ] Difficulty-based counter-spawning (EASY/HARD modes)
- [ ] Weapon bonuses vs enemy type tags
- [ ] Armor/penetration stat implementation
- [ ] Weapon transformation system (upgrade paths)
- [ ] More artifacts with unique effects
- [ ] World events system
