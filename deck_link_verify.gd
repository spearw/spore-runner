## Headless check of the UNCOUPLED character/deck/weapon model (design doc section 3). Run headless.
##   1. Run composition: the player's picks only, deduped, capped -- there is NO core deck.
##   2. Upgrade 0: one starting-weapon candidate rolled per chosen deck, from the right decks.
##   3. Identity: every character's starting_upgrades are ARTIFACTS (no character starts with a
##      weapon), and applying one granted costs no loadout slot.
##   4. Content: the once-exclusive weapons are back in their decks (Cinder Volley in fire, Axe in
##      melee), and the projectile deck now carries daggers + shotgun.
##   5. Stat coverage law (design doc section 1b, core deck dissolved): every themed deck carries
##      the max-health floor, armor is melee-exclusive, and every former core stat card is still
##      offerable from somewhere.
